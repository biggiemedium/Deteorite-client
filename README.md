# deteorite-client

This client was made by me (PX), I made this project to challenge myself to see if I could make a client thats completely custom (besides the Command system and the gui that I just skidded from my old client cuz im lazy).
Feel free to take any of this code just please credit me.

## downloads
I will not be providng any jars, if you want to compile the client on your own please follow this guide:

You can build the project and set the development environment by running gradlew eclipse and gradlew genEclipseRuns. 
then gradlew build or in intellij just by running gradlew genIntellijRuns then gradlew build.
If you just want to build it without setting up IDE environment then just run gradlew build then the built jar will be in build/libs.
